We are going to make an app that displays real time stock information and values in a condensed and a user friendly format so that user can efficiently look over their shares in different companies and businesses. Our app includes features like extrapulations of stocks from different companies like Samsung, NVidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon. There is an option to refresh the screen so the app can generate stocks for the 5 companies and give an estimated range for that second.


We are going to structure the app in a way that first we ask the user to choose which of the companies we provide they have a stock in then after that they click on the buttons of their companies and then they get information about the condtition of their stock and whether its growing or losing money so the user can track and decide what they want to do with their share in that company and also they know its value.
